<p align="center" style="text-align:center;"><b><span style="font-size:18.0pt;color:#990000;">Software Project </span></b></p>

<p align="center" style="text-align:center;"><b><span style="font-size:18.0pt;color:#990000;">(Due online by 11:59pm IST on Saturday, September 10)</span></b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">This software project must be done in groups of
two students, not less and not more, unless there are an odd number of students
in class, in which case one student will have to do it alone. In that case, the
student left out must email me asking for permission to work alone, before doing
so.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in;"><b>[MIPS32 Assembly <span class="GramE">programming]&#160;
<span style="font-weight:normal;">In</span></span></b> this project, you will
write a new MIPS32 assembly language program and simulate it on the MIPS
simulator called <span class="SpellE">QtSpim</span>.&#160; MIPS is the name of a
simple RISC ISA.&#160; Before attempting to do this question, familiarize
yourself with the MIPS ISA and how to use the software by visiting the class
website and reading all the documents on it related to MIPS and <span class="SpellE">QtSpim</span>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">Write a <span class="GramE">MIPS32 assembly language
programs</span> that takes a single 32-bit unsigned positive integer A,
computes the number of 1&#39;s that are in the binary representation of that
integer, and prints out the answer on the screen.&#160; For example, if A=13
the answer should be 3. This is because 13 in binary is 1101 (ignoring leading
zeros), so there are 3 1&#39;s in the binary representation; if A=31 the answer
should be 5 (11111).&#160; In writing the program, do <b>not </b>attempt to
call any library function for parity or any other library function. The MIPS
assembly code you write should do all of the computation by itself. <b>Please
put your entire code in the _main function. </b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">Write your code by using the provided MIPS32
sample assembly language programs as a guide. Run all of those programs to verify
that they work. Carefully read and understand at least two of the simpler
examples as needed to write your code.<b></b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">The computation should be done using <b>bit masking</b>.
Recall that bitmasking is where we use bitwise operators to extract information
about specific bits in a given number. For example, if A=101 is our number and
M=001 is our mask, A &amp; M will tell us whether the least significant bit of
A is 1 or 0. For our program, our mask M will remain the same (1), and we will
repeatedly right shift A and compute A &amp; M. On our first iteration 101
&amp; M = 1, on our second iteration 010 &amp; M = 0, and on our third
iteration 001 &amp; M = 1. If we keep track, there were 2 1&#39;s in A. Follow the
same logic in your program. Remember we are dealing with 32 bit numbers, not 3
bit numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">Your program should not take any input from the
screen.&#160; Instead, it should hard-code in the value of A in the
program.&#160; Do this by declaring a global variable A in your program, and
initializing it to its known constant value, such as 13.&#160; (To see how to
declare an initialized global, look at example1.s among the sample MIPS programs.
To do I/O, look at example3io.s.)</p>

<p>Example: If A = 13, then your MIPS session console output should look like
the following:</p>

<blockquote style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt;">

<p>There are 3 1&#39;s in the inputted number</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When debugging your program, you may find it helpful to use <span class="SpellE">QtSpim</span> to step through the program instruction by
instruction, examine the values of registers during execution and set
breakpoints.&#160; These are very easy to do -- use the <span class="SpellE">QtSpim</span>
online help to learn to do these tasks and try them out for your program.<b></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>For each group of two students, only
one of them should submit the following for the Project. TA Joseph will email you
submission instructions at a later date.</span></b><span></span></p>
